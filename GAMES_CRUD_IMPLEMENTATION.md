  'b_athletic_id': 'uuid',        // Team B
  'score_a': 0,                    // Team A score
  'score_b': 0,                    // Team B score

### 2. Repository Design Benefits
Comprehensive repository methods prepared upfront:
- Easier UI implementation
- Consistent data access patterns
- Ready for future features (athletes, stats)

### 3. JSONB Flexibility
athletics_standings and partials as JSONB provides:
- Flexible data structures
- No schema changes for variations
- Easy expansion for new features

### 4. Status Management
Color-coded status system improves:
- Quick visual scanning
- Game lifecycle understanding
- Filter effectiveness

## Conclusion

The Games CRUD page provides a solid foundation for game management with comprehensive support for both bracket and unique game types. The interface is intuitive, responsive, and follows established patterns from other CRUD pages in the application.

Key achievements:
- Dual game type support (bracket and unique)
- Comprehensive form validation
- Search and multi-filter capabilities
- Clean, expandable card layout
- Integration with admin panel
- Ready for athlete and statistics management

Next development phase will focus on implementing the Athletes and Statistics tabs within GameManagementPage to complete the full game management workflow.
